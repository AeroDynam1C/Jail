Changes

*With this being version 3 of this plugin, a couple things have changed but the core concept is still the exact same. Here are some drastic changes:*
- Time can now be entered different formats, 3hours or 15mins or 4days
- New language system
- New config system (per jail configs are going to make a come back)
- Items in the config use item names now, **not** the ids

ToDo
===
- Guards

Done
===
- Muted Prisoners are now muted
- Implemented counting down time **always use the bukkit scheduler, unless your tick rate is slow as the other way we do it is not always stable**
- New command system, internally we handle commands a lot better
- Delete commands are now remove
- Language system (adding language strings as I use them, be patient with me)
- Handcuffs are now implemented
- The time passed can be represented by time shorthand, aka "3hours" or "15minutes" or etc (defaults to minutes)
